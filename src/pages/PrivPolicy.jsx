              We collect your personal information primarily from you. However,
              sometimes we may collect personal information about you from third
              parties for the purposes described above where it is unreasonable
              or impracticable to collect it directly from you, and we may do
              this on one or more occasions. For example, even though your
              application is for Commercial credit, we may collect information
              about you from a business which provides information about
              consumer creditworthiness for the purpose of assessing your
              application. Other third parties that we may collect your
              information from include the supplier of the Equipment; our
              agents; other credit providers; insurers; any of your employers,
              former employers, referees, banks, landlords, guarantors,
              accountants, lawyers and financial advisers; your executor,
              administrator or attorney; service providers to us (including debt
              collection agencies, introducers, private investigators,
              professional advisers); professional organisations; internet
              sources; public and subscriber-only databases; credit reporting
              bodies, any person considering purchasing the business or any
              credit facility (or any part of the business or credit facility)
              the subject of any of our products or any person to whom we may
              assign your credit contract/s (and their advisors and
              representatives); any person considered necessary in our view to
              execute your instructions; and government authorities. The
              circumstances in which we may do so include, for example, where we
              need information from a third party to assist us to deal with any
              application or request made by you (such as to verify information
              you have provided or to assess your circumstances) or to assist us
              to locate or communicate with you.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The consequences of you not providing to us the personal
              information that we require can include that we will not be able
              to approve your application for credit or a related product, or
              that we will not be able to deal with future requests or queries
              from you in connection with credit we provide.

              Some of the organisations to whom we may disclose your personal
              information (including your credit information or credit
              eligibility information) will be located overseas and may not have
              an Australian link. The countries in which overseas recipients are

              please see our Privacy Policy and Credit Reporting Policy

              us disclosing your personal information to overseas recipients,
              Australian Privacy Principle (“APP”) 8.1 will not apply to the
              disclosure (which means that we will not be obliged under the
              Privacy Act to take reasonable steps to ensure that an overseas
              recipient does not breach the APPs, and we may not be liable under
              the Privacy Act if the recipient does not act consistently with
              the APPs). By applying for this product, you consent to
              disclosures to overseas recipients.

              that we may give them about you (such as about defaults and
              serious credit infringements) and details regarding how those
              credit reporting bodies use and disclose that information to
              credit providers and their policies about managing the
              information. You have important rights regarding access,
              correction and complaints relating to your credit reporting
              information, as well as certain rights to prevent its use for
              direct marketing or where you have been a victim of fraud. You
              will also find details about these rights on the same page. You
              can also ask us to provide you with a copy of this important
              information.

              You also agree that we or any credit provider we choose can
              obtain, from any business providing information about commercial
              creditworthiness, consumer and or commercial credit reports about
              you for the purposes of assessing applications for commercial
              credit.

              You agree that we can disclose your name, residential address and
              date of birth to a credit reporting body so that the credit
              reporting body can provide an assessment to us of whether the
              information provided by you matches (in whole or in part) the
              information in the credit reporting body’s possession or control
              (which may include personal information held by the credit
              reporting body about you or other individuals). This will be done
              for the purpose of verifying your identity as required under
              Australia’s anti‐money laundering and counter‐terrorism laws where
              applicable. If you would prefer us to use another form of
              verification, such as your passport or driver’s licence, you must
              notify us and provide us with any information that we request.

              listed on the Do Not Call Register and your email or other
              electronic addresses) to provide you with information about our
              other products and services and the products and services offered
              by our dealers, insurers (such as insurers who provide
              credit‐related insurance), our related companies or suppliers.
              This includes communicating with you via emails, text messages,
              phone messages or other electronic messages (without an
              unsubscribe facility). If you no longer wish us to use or disclose
              your personal information for these purposes, please tell us by
