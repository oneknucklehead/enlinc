                    <p>
                      When you're leasing the equipment, you avoid the need to
                      pay any upfront costs or fork out a large lump sum which
                      will allow you to allocate your resources and spending
                      more efficiently. Giving you the flexibility to portion
                      your funds to other areas if need be.

                    <p>
                      As with any Lease Payments for your business, all lease
                      expenses are fully tax-deductible and will more likely
                      than not save you money in the long run.

                    <p>
                      When you sign onto our Maintenance packages as part of
                      your Lease, we will replace certain equipment without
                      further costs if your maintenance schedules have been all
                      met.

                    <p>
                      Once you reach the end of your lease term, you have the
                      option to keep your current equipment or look at upgrading
                      to the Latest Technology with the newest features and
                      hardware.
